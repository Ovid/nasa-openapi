# Unofficial NASA OpenAPI Specification

The official [NASA API website](https://api.nasa.gov/) lists many NASA apis.
Unfortunately, I have not been able to find a clear specification for all of
them, so I've been building an [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) document,
starting with [api.nasa.gov](https://api.nasa.gov), found in
`nasa/api-nasa-gov/openapi.yaml`.

Currently, you should be able to drop the document into [the online Swagger
Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/) to make it easier to read the document.
You can use the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/) to
automatically build a client for your programming languages of choice.

This project is a work in progress. Only three API endpoints are currently
supported.
